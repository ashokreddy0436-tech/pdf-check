
implicit wait: Wait for a set amount of time for all elements.

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Explicit wait: Wait for a specific condition to be met.

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("username")));

FluentWait :FluentWait is an advanced version of WebDriverWait, allowing custom polling intervals and ignoring specific exceptions.

Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
												.withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))                       
												.pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5))                      
												.ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class); 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Page object model(POM):
- page object model will help to create object repositries for web elements
- each page has separate class with web elements
- improves reusability and maintanence


pom.xml manages dependencies, build lifecycle, and plugins required for the project.


use of TestNg:
-Annotation support
-organizing test cases
-grouping and proiaritizing
-parallel test cases execution
-@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod


Alrets:
Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
alert.accept(); // or alert.dismiss()

ArrayList: stores elements in order and allows duplicates.

HashMap: stores key-value pairs and does not allow duplicate keys.



throw: is used to explicitly throw an exception.

throws: is used in method signature to declare exceptions.



Static methods: belong to the class and can be accessed without creating an object.

Non-static methods: belong to instances and require an object to be accessed.

OOPS: Object oriented programming language:

Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenace by 
providing some rules.

1. Inheritance    -acquiring the properties of super class to sub class is called as Inheritance(achivied by "extends" keyword)
2. polymorphism   - One entity showing different behaviour is called as polymorphism
3. encapsulation  - The process of wrapping the data members(Global variables) and memberfunction(methods) into a single unit(class) is called as Encapsulation.
4. Abstraction    - process of hiding the internal implementation and showing the necessary data to the end user


1. Inheritance  ------------ 
It is the First Pillar of OOPS.
Inherit means acquire, posses, access, take, etc.
One class acquiring the properties of another class is called as
 Inheritance.
 extends keyword 
extends is a keyword which indicates that we are creating a new
 class from an existing class

Types Of Inheritance:
1.Single Level- one sub class and one super class
2.Multi Level - multiple sub classes and multiple super classes
3.Hierarchical
4.Multiple - multiple super classes & one sub class (not possible)
5.Hybrid-

METHOD OVERLOADING:
THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING MULTIPLE METHODS WITH SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS LIST IS CALLED AS METHOD OVERLOADING.
 - Number or type of arguments must be different.
 Ex:  testing()
 testing(String name)
 testing(String name,int orderid)
 
 Method Overriding:
Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class
//Ex-1 
class Parents   
{ 
  public void car()//Overridden method 
  { 
    System.out.println("Blue color"); 
  } 
} 
class Son extends Parents 
{ 
  public void car()//Overriding method 
  { 
    System.out.println("Black color"); 
  } 

2.Polymorphism  ------------ 
• it is a greek word. 
• poly means many and morphism means forms. 
One thing showing multiple behaviour is called as polymorphism. 
(or) 
One entity showing different behaviour is called as polymorphism.
  - A.Compile time polymorphism :
During compile time one thing showing multiple behaviour is called as 
compile time polymorphism.
  -B.Run time polymorphism :
During Run/Execution time one thing showing multiple behaviour is called 
as Run time polymorphism. 

3.Encapsulation  ------------ 
• The process of wrapping the data members(Global variables) and member
 function(methods) into a single unit(class) is called as
 Encapsulation.
 • The main purpose of encapsulation is to achieve security of data
 
 Object Casting
• Converting one type of object into another type of object is called 
as Object Casting. 
They are of 2 types :- 
A.Upcastng 
B.Downcasting 

 Upcasting : 
• Converting sub class object type into super class object type is 
called as upcasting. 
During up-casting only super class behaviour is visible, sub class 
behavior is hidden
ex:upcasted object 
   Student s1 = new Admin(); 
   
 Downcasting :
• Converting a super class object type into sub class object type is
 called as downcasting.
 (or) 
• Converting an upcasted object into normal form is called as
 downcasting.
 • During downcasting both sub class and super class behaviour is
 visible.
ex:downcasted object 
  Admin a1 = (Admin) s1; //Admin a1 = new Admin()  
  
4.Abstraction ( Abstract + ion ) ------------ 
• It is the second pillar of OOPS concept. 
• The process of hiding the internal implementation and showing the 
necessary data to the end user is called as Abstraction. 
• In other words, we can say that we are not going to show method 
implementation, we will just provide method header and method 
signature
